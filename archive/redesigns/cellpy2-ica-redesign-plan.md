# Plan: redesign of the ica utils (dQ/dV **and** dV/dQ, a specced frame, a pure core)

**Date:** 2026-07-09
**Closes:** the wave-3 design gap in the
[utils migration plan](cellpy2-utils-migration-plan.md) §2 ("`utils/ica.py`:
port; dq/dv on top of `curves`; scipy stays app-side; **spec the ICA output
frame while at it**"). Fourth doc in the utils redesign series, after
[batch](cellpy2-batch-redesign-plan.md),
[plotting](cellpy2-plotting-redesign-plan.md) and
[collectors](cellpy2-collectors-redesign-plan.md).
**Foundation:** [loader plan](../foundations/cellpy2-loader-port-and-extraction-plan.md)
§2.3 (`cellpycore.curves`), [conventions plan](../../ecosystem/cellpy2-conventions-plan.md).

## 1. Review: what ica.py is

`utils/ica.py` is 1 124 lines and — unlike batch/plotting/collectors — its
core is in decent shape: the `Converter` five-stage pipeline
(set → inspect → pre-process → increment → post-process,
`ica.py:27–417`) implements a defensible dQ/dV recipe (interpolate V(q),
optional Savitzky-Golay pre-smoothing, invert to q(V), diff, gaussian
post-smoothing, area normalization), and **`tests/test_ica.py` has 19
tests** — the best characterization net of any util reviewed so far. The
problems are at the edges: API sprawl, hidden state, silent failure, and
rot.

### 1.1 Four entry points × three ways to pass the same 20 options

| Entry | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `dqdv_cycle` (`ica.py:433`) | one cycle frame | tuple of numpy arrays |
| `dqdv_cycles` (`ica.py:555`) | multi-cycle frame | long frame (`cycle, voltage, dq`) — or `(keys, list-of-frames)` if `not_merged` |
| `dqdv_np` (`ica.py:659`) | raw arrays | tuple of numpy arrays |
| `dqdv` (`ica.py:787`) | CellpyCell | long frame, **or** a `(charge, discharge)` pair of wide MultiIndex frames if `split=True` |

The ~20 `Converter` parameters can arrive (a) as `Converter(**kwargs)`
constructor args, (b) tunneled through `**kwargs` of every entry point, or
(c) as `dqdv_np`'s 17 explicit parameters that are then copied onto the
converter through ten consecutive `if x is not None` blocks
(`ica.py:733–776`). The same 25-line "Keyword Args" block is copy-pasted
into three docstrings (`ica.py:449–469, 574–599, 808–836`) — already
drifting (`dqdv_np` spells the smoothing flag `diff_smoothing`; everywhere
else it is `smoothing`).

### 1.2 Two data paths that can disagree

The combined path (`_dqdv_combinded_frame` — typo and all, `ica.py:899`)
gets its curves from `cell.get_cap(method="forth-and-forth", ...)`. The
split path (`_dqdv_split_frames`, `ica.py:937`) instead calls
`collect_capacity_curves` from `cellpy.readers.data_structures` (analysis
code living in the *readers* package) with its own
`trim_taper_steps`/`steps_to_skip` options that the combined path does not
have. Same function name, different extraction semantics depending on
`split=` — and the split path builds its output as a list of DataFrames
carrying data in an ad-hoc `.name` attribute (`ica.py:869–896`), pasted
into wide MultiIndex frames. The `tidy` parameter means long-format in
`dqdv` but defaults differ per function (`dqdv(tidy=True)`,
`_dqdv_split_frames(tidy=False)`).

### 1.3 Silent failure and hidden state

- `dqdv_cycle` wraps each half-cycle in `except Exception` and, on *any*
  error, substitutes **empty arrays** (`ica.py:510–514, 534–538`) — a
  cycle can silently lose its charge branch; downstream plots simply show
  nothing. The ValueError-retry (disable post-smoothing and try again) is
  copy-pasted for both half-cycles (`ica.py:495–503, 523–531`).
- `Converter.inspect_data` **mutates option state**: it overwrites
  `normalizing_factor` from the data (`ica.py:218–224`), so a reused
  converter carries the previous cycle's normalization into the next.
- Direction semantics are implicit: the first half-cycle is
  `direction == -1`, the last is `+1` (`ica.py:485–486`) — charge vs
  discharge is left for the reader to infer, and the output column is
  named `dq` although it holds dQ/dV (units depend on the `normalize`
  option, documented nowhere).

### 1.4 Rot

- `from scipy.ndimage.filters import gaussian_filter1d` (`ica.py:14`) —
  deprecated namespace, **already warning on scipy 1.18** in the dev
  environment; will break on a future scipy.
- `increment_method="hist"` is half-implemented ("has not been thoroughly
  tested yet", `ica.py:329–349`) with TODO markers for a contributor
  ("assigned to Asbjoern", `ica.py:24`) that date back years. The
  nom-cap-normalization TODO appears twice (`ica.py:612–616, 844–848`).
- ~105 lines of `_check_*` dev functions plus an `if __name__ == "__main__"`
  block (`ica.py:1020–1124`) with hard-coded testdata paths.
- Duplicated Savitzky-Golay window arithmetic in `pre_process_data` and
  `increment_data` (`ica.py:250–260, 298–308`).

### 1.5 The missing sibling: dV/dQ (DVA)

cellpy computes only dQ/dV. Differential voltage analysis (dV/dQ vs
capacity) — the standard technique for electrode balancing and
degradation-mode analysis, particularly for full cells — does not exist
anywhere in cellpy or cellpycore. Some instrument readers *ingest* a
`dv_dq` column when the cycler exports one (`arbin_sql_csv.py:35`,
`maccor_txt_one.py:24`, ...), but there is no way to compute it from the
curves. Ironically, the existing `Converter` pipeline computes the needed
intermediate — the smoothed V(q) representation *before* the inversion to
q(V) — and discards it; dV/dQ is one `np.gradient` away from data the code
already has in hand.

### 1.6 Consumers

`collectors.ica_collector` (→ `dqdv`), `batch_tools/batch_helpers.py:391`
(`_extract_dqdv` → `dqdv_np`, feeding batch's `export_ica` CSVs),
`easyplot` (three call sites; module already scheduled for removal), the
plotting plan's future `ica_plot` family, and the tests. The cellpy-core-dev
validation notebook `03_capacity_curves.py` exercises `dqdv_cycles`
end-to-end and doubles as a visual check.

## 2. Design principles

1. **Two public verbs, one machinery.** `dqdv()` and `dvdq()` accept a
   cell, a curves frame, or two arrays; everything else becomes a
   deprecated alias. Input polymorphism replaces the four-function menu,
   and both derivatives ride the same extraction/smoothing pipeline —
   dV/dQ (DVA) is new capability, not new machinery (§1.5).
2. **One options object.** `IcaOptions` dataclass is the single source of
   truth for the recipe parameters — one definition, one docstring, shared
   by function, class shim and collectors.
3. **A specced output frame.** Long format, always the same columns:
   `cycle, direction, voltage, dqdv` for ICA and
   `cycle, direction, capacity, dvdq` for DVA (each carries the other
   coordinate as an extra column so both curves can be cross-plotted).
   Wide format is an explicit converter, not an entry-point mode. This is
   the "spec the ICA output frame" item from the utils plan, and the
   contract the plotting plan's `ica_plot`/`dva_plot` families and the
   collectors plan's `collect_ica` build on.
4. **Pure core, thin state.** The math becomes a stateless function
   `transform_half_cycle(voltage, capacity, options) -> (v, dqdv, meta)`;
   options are never mutated by data inspection (derived quantities like
   the effective normalization factor live in the returned meta).
5. **One data path.** All curve extraction via the curves contract
   (`cellpycore.curves` when it lands; `c.get_cap` until then). The
   `collect_capacity_curves` side door from the readers package closes.
6. **Failures are visible.** Per-half-cycle errors are collected and
   reported (warning summarizing which cycles/directions failed);
   `strict=True` raises. Empty output is never a silent substitute.
7. **Scipy stays here.** The ICA math remains cellpy-side (cellpycore is
   scipy-free); if the binning method ever materializes as a polars-native
   algorithm it can move to core later without changing this API.

## 3. Proposed shape

A single module — `cellpy/ica.py` (shim kept at `cellpy.utils.ica`); ica is
too small to justify a package:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class IcaOptions:
    # interpolation
    voltage_resolution: float | None = None
    capacity_resolution: float | None = None
    max_points: int | None = None
    interpolation_method: str = "linear"
    # smoothing
    pre_smoothing: bool = False
    diff_smoothing: bool = False
    post_smoothing: bool = True
    savgol_window_divisor: int = 50
    savgol_order: int = 3
    voltage_fwhm: float = 0.01
    gaussian: GaussianOptions = ...
    # normalization
    normalize: Literal["area", "nom_cap", False] = "area"   # today's True == "area"
    normalizing_factor: float | None = None
    normalizing_roof: float | None = None
    # differentiation
    increment_method: Literal["diff"] = "diff"   # "hist" pending §6 Q2

def dqdv(source, cycles=None, direction="both", options=None,
         strict=False, **overrides) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """source: CellpyCell | tidy curves frame | (voltage, capacity) arrays.
    Returns the specced long frame: cycle, direction, voltage, dqdv.
    Frame .attrs carry units, options used, and per-cycle failure notes."""

def dvdq(source, cycles=None, direction="both", options=None,
         strict=False, **overrides) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Differential voltage analysis (DVA) — same sources and options.
    Returns: cycle, direction, capacity, dvdq (voltage carried along).
    NEW capability (§1.5): computed as dV/dq on the smoothed V(q)
    representation the pipeline already builds — no q(V) inversion step,
    so it is numerically *simpler* than dQ/dV."""

def to_wide(ica_frame) -> pd.DataFrame          # explicit wide conversion
def transform_half_cycle(voltage, capacity, options,
                         derivative="dqdv") -> HalfCycleResult
                                                 # the pure core (public: it IS
                                                 #   dqdv_np's use case);
                                                 #   derivative="dqdv" | "dvdq"
```

- `direction="charge" | "discharge" | "both"` replaces `split=True` (the
  old split output = `to_wide(frame[frame.direction == ...])`).
- The `dq` column is renamed `dqdv` with the old name kept as a duplicate
  column behind a deprecation flag for one release (collectors and
  plotting migrate in the same wave).
- `Converter`, `dqdv_cycle`, `dqdv_cycles`, `dqdv_np` remain as thin
  deprecated wrappers over the new core for one minor release — the 19
  existing tests keep passing against the shims until they are ported.
- The retry-without-post-smoothing fallback becomes one code path in
  `transform_half_cycle` (logged into result meta, not copy-pasted).
- `taper trimming` (`trim_taper_steps`/`steps_to_skip`) becomes an option
  of the curve-extraction call, available to *both* directions and the
  combined path — closing the §1.2 asymmetry.
- The scipy import is fixed (`scipy.ndimage`), the savgol window helper is
  extracted, dev `_check_*` functions move to tests/notebooks.
- Normalization semantics differ per derivative: `normalize="area"` is an
  ICA concept; for `dvdq` the default is `normalize=False` (DVA is
  conventionally plotted raw, with peak *positions* on the capacity axis
  carrying the information). Options validation rejects meaningless
  combinations instead of silently applying them.

Estimated size: **~500–600 lines** (from 1 124), most of it the ported
math; dV/dQ itself adds only ~30 lines to the core.

## 4. Migration plan

Wave 3 in the utils plan sequencing (after plotting Phase 2, alongside
`ocv_rlx`). Small enough to land as one arc:

**Phase 0 — extend the net (½ day).** The 19 tests are the base; add
golden *numeric* snapshots of `dqdv` output for two cells from
`cellpy-core-dev/data` (values, not shapes) and a charge/discharge-split
case, so the §1.2 unification is measurable. Add a failing-cycle test
capturing today's silent-empty behavior (to be flipped in Phase 1).

**Phase 1 — pure core + options (1–1.5 days).** `IcaOptions`,
`transform_half_cycle`, scipy-import fix, state-mutation fix, error
collection. Old entry points re-implemented on the core; golden tests must
match (except the documented silent-empty → warned-failure change).

**Phase 2 — the new `dqdv` + `dvdq` + spec (1–1.5 days).** Input
polymorphism, specced frames with `.attrs`, `to_wide`, direction handling
on the single data path; `dvdq` lands here as the pure core's second
derivative mode, validated against instrument-exported `dv_dq` raw columns
where available (Arbin SQL test data) as a sanity reference. Old functions
become deprecation shims. Docs: one options table replaces the three
copy-pasted kwargs blocks.

**Phase 3 — consumers (½–1 day).** `collect_ica` (collectors plan §3.2)
and the plotting plan's `prepare/ica.py` consume the specced frame;
`batch_helpers._extract_dqdv` re-pointed or retired with batch's export
rework; tests ported off the shims.

**Phase 4 — removals (2.x cadence).** Shims (`Converter`, `dqdv_cycle`,
`dqdv_cycles`, `dqdv_np`, `dq` column alias) out in 2.1;
`collect_capacity_curves` in the readers package deprecated in favor of
the curves contract.

Total: **~3.5–4.5 days**, consistent with the utils plan's wave-3 budget
(the extra half day is the new dV/dQ capability, not overhead).

---

## 5. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Numeric drift in the port (interpolation/smoothing order is subtle) | Golden numeric snapshots from Phase 0; port is a move, not a rewrite — the math functions transplant nearly verbatim |
| Silent-empty → visible-failure changes notebook behavior | It only *adds* a warning; output frames gain rows only where errors were previously eaten. Release-notes item with example |
| `normalize=True` default surprises (output units depend on it) | Kept as default (`"area"`), but now documented in the options table and recorded in frame `.attrs` |
| `hist`/binning method has an intended future | Decision forced in §6 rather than carrying dead branches; the pure-core seam makes adding a second `increment_method` trivial later |
| scipy pin drift on py3.14+ | The import fix removes the known time bomb; scipy usage is otherwise stable API (`interp1d`, `savgol_filter`, `gaussian_filter1d`, `simpson`) |

---

## 5b. Implementation record (2026-07-19, cellpy#590)

Landed as one arc rather than four phases; Phase 3 (consumers) is partly
deferred, see below.

**What shipped.** `cellpy/ica.py` (~1 650 lines including the deprecated 1.x
surface; the new core alone is ~550, in line with the estimate).
`IcaOptions` + `GaussianOptions`, the pure `transform_half_cycle`,
`dqdv`/`dvdq` with three source kinds, `IcaCols`/`ICA_COLS`, `to_wide`.
`cellpy.utils.ica` is now a re-export shim.

**The port was faithful.** The 1.x entry points were *reimplemented on the new
core* rather than kept as a second copy of the math, which is what makes the
Phase 0 oracles worth having: all eight suites reproduce, byte-identically on
one machine (`regenerate_goldens.py --verify`) and to ~1e-5 relative across
platforms. The split path and the wide MultiIndex path included.

**Two tolerance mistakes worth remembering** (CI caught both). The metrics
file rounds column sums for readability, and the first version compared them
with `==` — rounding does not make a float portable, and Linux produced
`122.614595` against a Windows golden of `122.614594`. The second attempt
tightened the *frame* comparison to `rtol=1e-8`, reasoning from how much the
sums had moved; sums average errors out and individual values do not, so all
16 went red. Measured spread between Windows and Linux on this data is
**1e-7 to 5e-7 relative** (scipy interpolation/filtering), so the comparison
uses pandas' 1e-5 default. Anything tighter tests the BLAS.

**Decisions taken on §6.**

1. **`dq` → `dqdv`: renamed, with the old name kept as a duplicate column**
   for one release (as recommended). Registered in `DEPRECATIONS.md`.
2. **`hist`/binning: quarantined, not yet deleted.** `IcaOptions` rejects
   `increment_method="hist"` with a message pointing here; the branch survives
   only inside the deprecated `Converter`, so the 1.x test that exercises it
   still runs. **Still needs a call for 2.1: finish it or delete it.**
3. **`normalize="nom_cap"`: deferred.** `normalizing_roof` remains as the
   plumbing hook, so promoting it later is small.
4. **Full-cell dQ/dV and dV/dQ: deferred**, as a feature on top of the specced
   frame.
5. **`transform_half_cycle` is public**, as recommended.

**New question, and the reason Phase 3 is only half done — see §6.6.**

## 6. Open questions for the maintainer

1. **Column rename `dq` → `dqdv`** in the specced frame — worth the
   one-release dual-column shim, or keep `dq` forever?
2. **The `hist`/binning increment method** (the old "assigned to Asbjoern"
   TODO): finish it as `increment_method="bin"` with tests, or delete the
   branch? (This plan works either way; the seam is designed for it.)
3. **Normalization to nominal capacity** (the twice-repeated TODO):
   promote to `normalize="nom_cap"` in this rework (small: factor plumbing
   already exists via `normalizing_roof`), or defer?
4. `dqdv`/`dvdq` for full cells (the module-header TODO): in scope for the
   port, or a separate feature after cellpy 2.0? Note that `dvdq` makes
   this more pressing — electrode balancing from full-cell DVA (fitting
   half-cell reference curves) is the classic application, and would be a
   natural later extension on top of the specced frame.
5. Should `transform_half_cycle` be public API (recommended: it is the
   honest replacement for `dqdv_np` power users), or private?

6. ~~**NEW — which way round is `direction`?**~~ — **resolved (decision,
   2026-07-20, maintainer, cellpy#591/#598): cell-centric.** "charge" means
   the *cell* charging, agreeing with `get_ccap`/`get_dcap` and the summary
   columns; the electrode-centric reading is derived by swapping labels when
   `cycle_mode == "anode"`. `ica_collector` is on the specced frame;
   `_select_direction` handles both encodings the plotters see; anode film
   plot labels flipped once (release-noted). Original question kept below
   for the record.

   The specced frame spells direction out as `"charge"` /
   `"discharge"`, which forces a decision 1.x never had to make because it
   handed back the raw ±1 code.

   `get_cap(categorical_column=True)` gives **-1 to the first half-cycle**.
   For cellpy's default `cycle_mode="anode"` the first half-cycle is `get_dcap`
   — the **cell discharge** (`capacity_curves.py:337–345`). So the frame
   currently labels -1 as `"discharge"`, matching the `get_ccap`/`get_dcap`
   naming it came from.

   But `collectors.ica_plotter` selects `direction < 0` and titles it
   **"charge"** (`collectors.py:2136–2140`) — the electrode-centric reading,
   in which lithiating the anode is "charging the electrode" even though the
   cell is discharging.

   Both are defensible and both are in the codebase today. Whichever we adopt,
   the other set of plots gets relabelled, so this is a domain call rather than
   a refactor:

   - **(a)** cell-centric (current frame behaviour): -1 is `"discharge"` for
     an anode cell. Then `ica_plotter`'s labels flip.
   - **(b)** electrode-centric: -1 is `"charge"` regardless of `cycle_mode`.
     Then the frame stops agreeing with `get_ccap`/`get_dcap`.
   - **(c)** carry both — a `direction` (cell) and an `electrode_direction`
     column — and let the plotter choose.

   (Historical note — before the resolution, `collectors.ica_collector`
   deliberately stayed on the 1.x frame through the private
   `_dqdv_combined_frame`.)
