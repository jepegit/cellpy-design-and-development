# Stage 0 — GitHub issues (created 2026-07-09)

Stage 0 = the foundations layer: every plan's Step-0/Phase-0 characterization work,
golden fixtures, performance baselines, oracle harnesses, and shared conventions —
behavior-preserving by definition, and the precondition for starting any refactor
stage with confidence.

All issues carry the label **`cellpy2-stage0`**. Tracking issue:
**[jepegit/cellpy#439](https://github.com/jepegit/cellpy/issues/439)**.

## Suggested order

`#428` first (fixture convention — everything depends on it), `core#114` + `#438` in
parallel (cheap, unblock decisions), then `#429–#433` + `#434`/`#436` in any order,
`#435`/`#437` whenever.

## Exit criteria (from #439)

- All characterization suites green on master; fast subsets marked `essential`.
- Goldens regenerate deterministically via script; no hand-edited fixtures.
- Benchmark baselines committed **before** any refactor PR merges.
- Value-parity comparator passes trivially against the current bridge.
- The six #438 decisions recorded in their plan documents.

## Status + yolo labels (updated 2026-07-09)

`#428`–`#431` **closed** (done). Remaining open issues judged fit for issue-flow's
hands-off **`yolo`** mode (well-specified, mechanical or pattern-following, low blast
radius, oracle-guarded, no open maintainer decisions) and labeled accordingly:
`#432` (already labeled by another agent), `#433`, `#434`, `#435`, `#436`, `#437`,
`core#114`. **Not** yolo: `#438` (maintainer decisions) and the `#439` umbrella.

## Stage 0 complete (2026-07-10/11)

All twelve issues **closed** (tracking #439 closed). Delivered in cellpy:
`tests/golden_support.py` + `dev/regenerate_goldens.py` (#428),
`tests/test_cellpy_file_roundtrip.py` incl. the limits-prefix trap pin (#429),
config characterization + inventory contract (#430),
`tests/test_unit_handling_stage0.py` with the strict-xfail registry-interop test
(#431), per-loader and curve golden snapshots (#432/#433), `tests/parity.py` +
`test_value_parity.py` (#434), scan addenda (#435), `benchmarks/` with GHA
ubuntu-latest baselines (#436 — baselines captured on the CI runner, not locally;
peak-RSS informational-only; v9 benchmark deferred until the format lands),
`cellpy/_deprecation.py` + exception-tree stubs (#437), the six #438 decisions
(recorded in the plan docs — note: the recording branch was initially stranded
unmerged on the jepegit mirror as `cursor/438-decision-register-ffdc` and was
merged to this repo's main 2026-07-11, commit 8761be1), and the core doc-sync
(core#114). Stage 1 may proceed; see [stage1-github-issues.md](stage1-github-issues.md).
